# ROCm tensor-parallel: experiment log

## 2026-07-24 — 2-rank TP throughput attempt (issue 06)

**Goal:** measure real generation throughput and per-GPU utilization for 2-rank
tensor parallelism against the recorded ~28–29 tok/s pipeline baseline, per
issue 06's go/no-go gate.

**Setup:** `ds4-bench -m /home/murphy/src/ds4/ds4flash.gguf --rocm
--gpu-devices 0,1 --cuda-tensor-parallel --prompt-file
speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt --ctx-start 2048 --ctx-max 2048 --step-incr
2048 --gen-tokens 128`, real hardware (4x AMD Radeon AI Pro R9700, 34GB VRAM
each), GPUs confirmed idle beforehand (~58MB used per GPU via `rocm-smi`).

**Result: could not run.** Two failures in sequence:

1. `--cuda-tensor-parallel requires an even number of GPUs >= 2
   (--gpu-devices gave 0)` — fixed by adding `--gpu-devices 0,1` explicitly
   (auto-detect picked 0 devices).
2. With `--gpu-devices 0,1` set, model placement failed:
   `ds4: CUDA EP cannot fit balanced stage 0 in pair budgets 26.96/26.96 GiB
   (43 layers remain)` / `ds4: failed to classify multi-tier placement`.
   The production model (`ds4flash.gguf`,
   DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-..., ~87GB on disk) does not fit within the
   ~68GB combined VRAM budget of a 2-GPU pair.
3. Adding `--ssd-streaming` to work around the fit does not help: the code
   explicitly rejects the combination — `ds4: --ssd-streaming is not
   compatible with multi-GPU placement` (checked at `ds4.c:55507`, guarded on
   `e->ssd_streaming && e->multi_tier`). Any multi-GPU placement (which TP
   inherently is) disables streaming as an escape hatch.

**Finding:** at the current 2-bit quantization (already near the practical
floor for this model), isolated 2-rank TP (using only 2 of the 4 GPUs)
cannot hold the full production model in VRAM, with or without streaming.
This is a hard constraint of the current build, not a benchmark
misconfiguration — full raw log at
`.scratch/rocm-tensor-parallel/bench-out/tp-2rank.log`.

**Decision: re-scope.** Recorded on issue 06 (see that file's Comments).
Rather than trying to force an isolated 2-rank measurement that the hardware
cannot support for this model, proceed directly to the four-GPU topology
decision (issue 11): two TP pairs pipelined, each pair only holding its
pipeline stage's layers (~half the model spread across 2 GPUs, comfortably
within budget). This reuses the already-correct 2-rank kernels/sharding
unchanged and, as a side effect, is the configuration that will actually fit
and produce a real, measurable throughput number — issue 11's own
acceptance criteria already call for throughput/utilization measurement
against the pipeline baseline, so the proof-of-value gate issue 06 wanted is
absorbed into that work rather than lost.
